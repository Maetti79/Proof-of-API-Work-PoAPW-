# PoAPW Tokenomics Report

## Simulation-Based Analysis (Optimized Model)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Report

This document provides a **quantitative tokenomics analysis** of the Proof of API-Work (PoAPW) protocol based on simulated usage data.

The goal is to validate that the optimized model:

* covers infrastructure and service costs
* remains inflation-safe under growth
* is resistant to economic abuse
* scales with real API demand

All simulations use the **final optimized ruleset**.

---

## 2. Model Summary (Final Rules)

### Payment & Fees

* Each API call has a declared token price (per route)
* Payment is embedded in the API call payload
* Settlement uses a claim–confirm mechanism
* Fixed **1% protocol fee** on every successful call
* Fees are used exclusively for infrastructure operations

### Minting (Optimized)

* Minting produces **Mint Credits (MC)**
* MC are non-transferable and usage-only
* MC convert 1:1 into real tokens **only when spent**
* Minting is enabled only during a **time-bound onboarding window** (30–60 days)

### Minting Caps

* Per route: `min(route_price × 10, 1,000)`
* Per API (all routes combined): **5,000 tokens/day**
* Per API collection: **1,000 tokens total**

### Anti-Abuse Controls

* Protocol-wide minimum route price enforced
* Failed calls mint zero
* High-volume usage does not increase minting

---

## 3. Simulation Setup

### Scope

* **10 projects** at launch
* Each project integrates **2–6 APIs**
* Calls per project per day: **500 – 50,000**
* Average route price: **2–50 tokens**
* Simulation horizon:

  * 30-day baseline
  * 12-month growth projection

## 4. 30-Day Baseline Simulation Results

### Usage & Spend (per project)

| Metric             | Range          |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Daily API calls    | 500 – 50,000   |
| Daily token spend  | ~5,000 – ~2.3M |
| 30-day token spend | ~147k – ~71M   |

### Protocol Fees (1%)

| Metric      | Range                |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Daily fees  | ~50 – ~23,700 tokens |
| 30-day fees | ~1.4k – ~711k tokens |

**Observation:** Infrastructure funding scales linearly with real usage.

---

### Minting (Per Project)

| Metric         | Value          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Daily mint cap | 5,000 tokens   |
| 30-day mint    | 150,000 tokens |

Across **10 projects**:

* **Total 30-day mint:** ~1,500,000 tokens

**Observation:** Minting reaches its cap quickly and does not scale with call volume.

---

## 5. Year-1 Growth Simulation

### Assumptions

* Projects grow from **10 → 30**
* Average calls per project per day grow from **5,000 → 80,000**
* Average route price: **20 tokens**

---

### Monthly Aggregates (Selected Points)

| Month | Projects | Monthly Token Spend | Monthly Fees (1%) | Monthly Minted |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | 10       | ~2.25M              | ~22.5k            | ~1.5M          |
| 6     | 19       | ~16.15M             | ~161.5k           | ~2.85M         |
| 12    | 30       | **~48.0M**          | **~480k**         | **~4.5M**      |

---

## 6. Key Ratios (Health Indicators)

### Mint vs Spend

* Month 12:

  * Tokens spent: ~48M
  * Tokens minted: ~4.5M

➡️ **>90% of tokens must be purchased via the marketplace**

### Fees vs Mint

* Protocol fees dominate minting value
* Minting acts only as a bootstrap mechanism

---

## 7. Energy-Anchored Perspective

Marketplace reference rate:

* **1,000 tokens = 1 Wh**

Month 12 minting equivalent:

* ~4,500 Wh (4.5 kWh)

This is negligible compared to the infrastructure implied by ~48M tokens of usage.

## 8. Abuse & Attack Simulation Results

| Attack Vector    | Economic Outcome               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Self-calls       | Unprofitable (fees + caps)     |
| API loops        | Unprofitable (fees accumulate) |
| Cheap-route spam | Blocked by min price + caps    |
| Callback replay  | Rejected (nonce / call_id)     |
| High-volume spam | Costs attacker; no extra mint  |

**Conclusion:** All tested attack vectors are economically negative.

---

## 9. Token Flow Summary

> Usage drives spend → spend funds infrastructure → minting is capped and temporary → marketplace supplies demand.

There is no path to extract value without delivering real API work.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The PoAPW tokenomics model demonstrates:

* predictable and bounded token issuance
* strong alignment between usage and revenue
* structural resistance to inflation and abuse
* enterprise-grade cost transparency

Minting accelerates onboarding.

**Usage sustains the system.**

This makes PoAPW suitable as long-term infrastructure rather than a speculative token economy.
